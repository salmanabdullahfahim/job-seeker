## Feature
1. Component-based architecture: The website is built using a component-based architecture, allowing for easy management and updating of specific parts of the website without affecting others.

2. Virtual DOM: We use a virtual DOM to optimize the performance of the website. This results in faster and more efficient updates.

3. JSX: The website's UI code is written using JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows for HTML-like code within JavaScript. This provides a more familiar syntax for developers and makes it easier to write and manage the UI code.
